    "#### 9.1.1 Definition of MASE\n",
    "\n",
    "MASE is the MAE of the forecast period divided by the MAE between the seasonal naive, or naive forecast and y in the training period.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MASE} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{H} \\sum\\limits_{t=N+1}^{N+H} |y_t - \\hat{y}_t|}{\\frac{1}{N-m} \\sum\\limits_{t=m+1}^{N} |y_t - y_{t-m}|}\n",

    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| $\\text{MASE}$ | Mean Absolute Scaled Error |\n",
    "| $y_t$ | **Actual value** at time $t$ |\n",
    "| $\\hat{y}_t$ | **Forecast value** at time $t$ |\n",
    "| $N$ | Total number of observations in the **training data** |\n",
    "| $H$ | Number of observations in the **test data** (forecast period) (from $t=N+1$ to $t=N+H$) |\n",
    "| $m$ | **Seasonal period** (e.g., $m=7$ for a weekly cycle in daily data) |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.2 MASE and Suitability for the Current Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The models adopted this time: holt-winters, SARIMAX (using Fourier terms), prophet, lightGBM, GRU.\n",
    "Generally,\n",
    "- Solar power generation forecast had a MASE of approximately 1.8-2.3, with a period of 1 day (48 frames for 30-minute interval data).\n",
    "- Electricity demand forecast had a MASE of approximately 0.5-0.9, with a period of 1 week (336 frames for 30-minute interval data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In conjunction with graph observations,\n",
    "- For solar power, the value after 24 hours is not expected to change drastically and is primarily influenced by weather factors. While total solar radiation and sunrise times differ significantly between January 1st and July 1st, the difference after just one day would be quite limited.\n",
    "- On the other hand, for electricity consumption, the difference from the same time one week later is expected to be somewhat larger due to human activities, weather, temperature, events, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these assumptions, and since forecasts are made for 30 days, with a training period of 60 days and a forecast horizon of 1 day, the error of the seasonal naive forecast is expected to be averaged over a slightly longer period, and thus smaller for solar power generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, there is a tendency for solar power generation forecasts to yield higher MASE values, so to confirm this situation, the following metric was introduced:"

    "#### 9.1.3 Introducing the Custom Metric My_Eval_Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Given that we are comparing the MAE of naive seasonal forecasts with the forecasts from each method, wouldn't it be appropriate to use the MAE of the naive seasonal forecast for the test period as the denominator? Furthermore, since we are comparing and dividing errors from the same data over the same period, there is inherent consistency.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the formula is: MAE of test period / MAE of seasonal naive forecast for test period\n",
    "* Data periods excluded during the creation of the seasonal naive forecast are also excluded from the numerator's MAE calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$MAE_{test}$ / $MAE_{test\\_seasonaly\\_naive}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon searching, I also encountered the term 'relative MAE'. However, this term appears to refer to measuring the relative magnitude of error using the formula: relative error = |predicted value - actual value| / actual value, which seems to differ from the concept I devised.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on, we will compare the evaluation results of the five methods, also utilizing this My_Eval_Index."

    "- This means it would come down to \"obtaining accurate weather forecast information.\" Beyond that, it would be necessary to consider real-time-like, few-hour delayed forecasts (e.g., \"It was sunny today, so power generation is likely to increase following this pattern\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike solar power, electricity demand forecasting is likely the sum of many intricate factors such as economic activity, making it inherently challenging.\n",
    "- Heating and cooling demand shares the same element as solar power: if only temperature could be accurately predicted. Other factors include events and economic activities; some events can be predicted to a certain extent in advance, but others, like a pandemic, are difficult to forecast.\n",
